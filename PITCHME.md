# Sandbox Project

This is project (git repo) with no rules on what you can do to it. Feel free to
try anything git commands you want to test out using this repo. Try things, test
things, experiement. Don't worry about corrupting the repo or breaking anything.

If you are not sure how to do something with git, give it a try here before
doing it in a repo that has any real impact.

# Some Math

This is just a test, to see if the MATHML stuff works

$$\sum_{i=0}^n i^2 = \frac{(n^2+n)(2n+1)}{6}$$

# Links

To get things to work, you have your PITCHME.md in github, etc, and then publish a gitpitch link:

- Example GitHub link: https://github.com/rbb/sandbox-foo/blob/master/PITCHME.md
- Corresponding GitPitch link:https://gitpitch.com/rbb/sandbox-foo
